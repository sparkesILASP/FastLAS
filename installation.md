The Ubuntu version of the latest FastLAS release can be downloaded from
[https://github.com/spike-imperial/FastLAS/releases](https://github.com/spike-imperial/FastLAS/releases).
We recommend that you copy it to somewhere in your PATH (for example,
/usr/local/bin/). You will also need to download
[https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases](Clingo 5) and copy it to
somewhere in your PATH.

After copying FastLAS to your PATH, you will be able to call FastLAS by
running `FastLAS learning_task.las` for any FastLAS learning task. There
are many examples of valid FastLAS learning tasks at
[https://github.com/spike-imperial/FastLAS/data/](https://github.com/spike-imperial/FastLAS/data/).
