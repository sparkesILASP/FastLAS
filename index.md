FastLAS is a new system for Inductive Logic Programming. It is based on
the Context-dependent Learning from Answer Sets framework used by
[ILASP](www.ilasp.com). The first release, as described in the upcoming
paper "Scalable Inductive Logic Programming Incorporating
Domain-specific Optimisation Criteria", to be presented at AAAI 2020,
has several restrictions, which mean that it is not nearly as general as
ILASP, but it is significantly more scalable, and allows a user to
express their own optimisation criteria.
