# FastLAS

FastLAS is a system for Inductive Logic Programming, originally
presented at AAAI 2020. This repository contains instructions for
downloading and installing FastLAS and reproducing the results in the
paper.

FastLAS2 is the latest version of the FastLAS system. It allows running
both the original FastLAS algorithm and the new FastNonOPL algorithm,
which is to be presented at IJCAI 2021. To run the original FastLAS (now
known as FastLAS1), use the flag `--opl`; alternatively, use the flag
`--nopl` to run FastNonOPL.

Any questions regarding FastLAS should be sent to mark.law09@imperial.ac.uk.
