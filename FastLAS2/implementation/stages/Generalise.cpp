generalisation: finding more general schemas of the initial very specific schemas

want rules R such that:
  1.there is some rule in the characteristic ruleset for which R is a subrule
  2.R is not a subrule of some other rule which has the same super-rules in the characteristic ruleset.

So, in other words, the goal is to remove literals from the body of rules in the characterstic ruleset.
However, this is restricted.
Intuitively, the new body (as a set) must be the intersection of bodies in the characterstic ruleset (as sets).

Parallel exection is split according to the head of schemas.
